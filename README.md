# Introduction
The goal of this project is to assist the Austin Animal Shelter in predicting the potential time that an animal will spend in the shelter. With our goal set, we decided in using their dataset as a base. To compliment the data provided we took the decition of webscraping for dog weight and size information, this helped us compliment the original database and build a better predictve model. In doing so, we are looking into providing a solution to issues that are common in shelters across the country. Although our shelter does not suffer of such, our model is able to provide prediction and better prepare the shelter to avoid issues such as: dirty conditions, lack of veterinary care, lack of adequate food and water, etc.
